# Sample website to display Obsidian documents

This project is a part of an open architecture design to publish documents from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). As mentioned in the [plugin](https://github.com/tamasmajer/obsidian-publish-to-unstorage-plugin), on this website the user can authenticate, get an API key, and view a published set of documents saved in an intermediary Unstorage server.
